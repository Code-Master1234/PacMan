# Pacman
This is the code for Pacman in python. Credit to https://pacmancode.com/ for this project. To play the game open up a terminal and type 'python run.py'.  When the screen opens up press the 'spacebar' to start the game.  You can also use the spacebar to pause and un-pause the game.  When playing the game, use the directional keys to move Pacman up, down, left, and right. *You will also need to make sure that Numpy is installed since some of the code depends on Numpy.  I really only use Numpy for a few things, but they do make those few things easier to do.
