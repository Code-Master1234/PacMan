# PacMan
This is the code for Pacman in python. Credit to https://pacmancode.com/ for this project. To play the game open up a terminal and type 'python run.py'.  When the screen opens up press the 'spacebar' to start the game.  You can also use the spacebar to pause and un-pause the game.  When playing the game, use the directional keys to move Pacman up, down, left, and right. You will also need to make sure that Numpy is installed since some of the code depends on Numpy.  It is only used for a few things, but it makes those few things easier to do.
